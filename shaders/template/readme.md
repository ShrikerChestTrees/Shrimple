## Editing Property Templates
The block, item, and entity property files are generated with a template builder. To modify these templates, you will need [PoTater](https://github.com/Null-MC/PoTater) to regenerate the final property files. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Null-MC/PoTater/releases) binary for your system, and place it in this `~/template` folder. Then run `~/update.sh` as needed to generate the new property files.
